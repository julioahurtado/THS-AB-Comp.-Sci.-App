# THS-AB-Comp.-Sci.-App

## Scheduke Android application

  This project was comepleted by @RicoCruzSuave and myself for a final project in our Computer Science class senior year of high school.
  It's is pretty rough to follow as we weeren't familiar with commenting our code correctly as we didn't expect others to see this code.
  A rough break down of the work done is as follows:
  
  * [@RicoCruzSuave](https://github.com/RicoCruzSuave): Back End
    1. Saving and loading classes and assignment information.
    2. Connecting above methods to UI interations.
    3. Connected Roughly about 30% of connecting UI elements to action methods in .java files (Mainly those that affected data structures)
    
  * [Julio Hurtado](https://github.com/julioahurtado): Front End
    1. Created XML layouts
    2. Connected Roughly about 70% of UI elements to action methods in .java files
    3. Created and maintained UI animations
    3. Layed out front end elements in onCreate()
